                text="&lt;p>A synthesis plan, for instance, can have hundreds of individual steps, many of which will produce undesired side reactions or by-products or simply not work at all. Now, though, AI is starting to increase the efficiency of both design and synthesis, making the enterprise faster, easier and cheaper while reducing chemical waste. In AI, machine-learning algorithms analyse all known past experiments that have attempted to discover and synthesize the substances of interest – those that worked and, importantly, those that failed. No single machine-learning tool can do all this at the push of a button, but AI technologies are moving rapidly into the real-world design of drug molecules and materials.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>An AI tool developed by researchers at the University of Münster in Germany, for example, repeatedly simulates the 12.4 million known single-step chemical reactions to come up with a multistep synthetic route – planning it 30 times faster than humans do. In the pharmaceutical arena, an AI-based technology called generative machine learning is also exciting. Most pharmaceutical companies store millions of compounds and screen them for the potential to serve as new drugs. But even with robotics and lab-automation tools, this screening process is slow and yields relatively few hits. Further, the “libraries” collectively include only a tiny fraction of the more than 1030 theoretically possible molecules. Using a data set describing the chemical structures of known drugs (and drug candidates), as well as their properties, machine-learning tools can construct virtual libraries of new compounds that have similar, and potentially more useful, characteristics.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
